# BitcoinTrans 

**BitcoinTrans** is a web application utilizing Blockchain.info API to retrieve the most recent transactions for any given   address.

## How to Run
1. Clone this repository
2. cd into the file path and enter "npm start"

**Note:** If cross-origin read blocking (CORB) is creating an issue with API calls, try to run on firefox using "BROWSER=firefox npm start"

**Side Note:** I have made some style changes in my separate branch if you would like to view it.
